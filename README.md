This project helped me dive deep into sales, customer behavior, and staff performance analytics using structured queries. Here's a breakdown of the insights I extracted using SQL:
📌 Key SQL Queries & Business Insights:
🏪 Found the total number of products sold by each store , along with store names
📈 Calculated the cumulative quantity sold for each product over time
💸 Identified the top-selling product (by total sales: quantity × price) in each category
🧾 Discovered the customer who spent the most overall on orders
💰 Found the highest-priced product in each category
🛍️ Listed the number of orders per customer per store
🙅‍♂️ Identified staff members with no sales
🔝 Ranked the top 3 most sold products by quantity
🧮 Calculated the median price across all products
🚫 Listed products never ordered using EXISTSlogic
🧑‍💼 Found staff who made more sales than the average of all staff
🧩 Identified customers who have ordered from every product category
🛠 Tools Used : SQL 
 📊 Dataset : USA Jenson Sales Dataset (Retail domain)
This project sharpened my skills in:
Joins and aggregations
Window functions and subqueries
Logical filtering and EXISTS/ ALLconditions
Business insight extraction from raw transactional data
Happy to connect with fellow SQL enthusiasts, data analysts, or anyone working on retail datasets. Let's share and grow together! 🙌
